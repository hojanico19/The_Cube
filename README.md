# The_Cube
Being confined in small spaces for long periods of time in space can cause health isues for astronauts, such as muscle mass and bone density loss. Efforts are made to reduce these effects with strict mandatory exercise routines. Radiation exposure in space is another challenge that can't be easily solved due to the lack of a protective magnetic field. This not only increases the risk of cancer but also causes vision problems, making it difficult for astronauts to enjoy activities like playing video games due to the sensitivity to lights. But one of the main isues, acording to studies is the challenge that mental health poses in space. On Earth, issues like boredom or mental health struggles can be easily addressed with solutions such as spending time with pets or staying in touch with friends. However, astronauts can't bring pets or socialize with friends, which often leads to feelings of boredom and sadness, and with communication delays onboard, live psychological support may not always be an option, which can lead to symptoms of irritability and depression within the crew. Studies suggest that pets are effective in reducing stress and depressive symptoms. Clearly, having a pet on board is not possible, but we propose a system that emulates the nurturing and care associated with pets through a smart device, allowing astronauts to care for a pet-robot that evolves through a rewards system based on the completion of tasks aimed at improving their mental health. Our Solution: The Cube “THE CUBE” is an interactive, AI powered, evolving pet-robot that allows astronauts to track their healthy habits, using a point system that allows them to upgrade their cube, unlocking new games, customizable features, and also new characteristics of the cube: speaking, movements, games, etc. The cube will be evolving as long as the astronauts take care of themselves, providing them with a sense of achievement and progress in an environment that can sometimes become too rutinary. Long missions away from loved ones and Earth can be emotionally taxing. The cube offers astronauts a sense of responsibility and emotional engagement, promoting positive habit formation through its rewards system. The unlockable features and games provide astronauts with a sense of achievement and progress, which can help break the monotony that can lead to mental fatigue. The interactive nature of the cube could also promote team-building exercises, offering astronauts a shared, enjoyable experience that strengthens social bonds, reducing interpersonal friction in confined spaces. Happy, mentally healthy astronauts are more productive and can handle the stresses of long-term space missions better. While designed for space missions, "THE CUBE" could be adapted for use in other isolated, high-stress environments, like submarines or research stations in extreme climates. It also has potential in healthcare settings, such as for patients with anxiety or depression, Autism Spectrum Disorders, or even elderly care and , where companionship robots are gaining traction. Overall, "THE CUBE" not only helps address the known psychological challenges of space travel but also presents broader applications and technological advancements, making it a worthy investment for both space agencies and the commercial market.
